Journey from Teaching to Programming. 

Coding has always been something that I was curious about. Many times have I wondered how strings of code could create the wonderful words seen in video games; or the simple interfaces seen on our smartphones. My interest in technology has always been there, but I never thought I had the time to actually learn nor did I have the means to make it possible. After college I decided to join *Teach for America* . I needed a job that would allow me to support myself an my family and teaching seemed like a fastest way to make that possible. My first year of teaching was rough to say the least: little work life balance, emotionally draining, and an overall constant workload. My second year was shaping up to be the same. Rather than stay in teaching I decided now is the time to explore this interest. 

I research countless of Coding Programs and ultimately decided on Flatiron. I wanted a program that was challenging, and that would help me achieve my goal. I want to switch into the tech field-- with the goal of becoming a software developer. I want to create programs and hopefully merge in my experience with education to create software that can help students. Futhermore, I am hoping to create more of a balance between my worklife and personal life.
